Idea: make the term variable _reactive_ - term change must invalidate any actions associated with the previous term

My questions about Raft:

The paper says that a follower should increment its current term on election timeout. However, if such a follower is partitioned from the rest of the system for a long time, several election timeouts may happen. This will cause it to have higher term number than the rest of the system.
When it comes back online, it will knock out the current leader (because it has higher term number), causing an unnecessary reelection in an otherwise well-functioning cluster.
